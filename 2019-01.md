## Git and GitHub workflow

### Creating a new repository from an existing GitHub one:

- fork project in GitHub account: creates a copy of the project/repository in my GitHub account at that time.

- At local server using git commands to interface with the project in GitHub. All git commands have to be executed inside a valid git repository, except git clone.

    1. `git clone [repository address]` to copy a remote repository locally and set up the git repository with a corresponding remote (web address) as origin - so it is recommended to do that with the original one. In case we don't have access to the original repository, the connection should be done by using HTTPS.  
        Note: for personal repositories prefer the SHH connection over HTTPS, which allow to connect direclty without password (create ssh-keygen and add it in your GitHub account).
        * `git remote -v` to show remote address connected to that git repository. 
        * `git remote add [remote name] [repository address]` to add other remote name. I can then use this command `git branch --set-upstream-to=arbarbeiro/master master` where *arbarbeiro* is the remote name and *master* the branch name to set them by default, so I don't need to specify them in each git pull/push. Recommended if I want to collaborate with the prject. 
    2. `git status` to see the status (differences between local and cloud rep. but this is done in the local repository so it won't be different if a git fetch isn't done before).
    3. `git fetch` to see the updates (new changes made in the cloud repository). A `git status` rigth after will show how many commits were made in this updated version.
    4. `git pull` to update the local repository with the verion existing on the could.


### Creating a new repository from zero:
- Only on GitHub to then clone.
- This is also necessary when we want to put an existing local repository in GitHub.

    1. Click up-right button on GitHub to make new repository with a markdown readme text (*.md) by default.
    2. `git init` to initiate .git repository locally in the desired folder.
    3. `git remote add [remote name] [repository address]`
    e.g. add origin git@github.com:arbarbeiro/notebook.git
    Note: 'origin' is the [remore name] used by default  
    4. `git fetch` to see what is already in cloud.(also use git status to more info at any time).
    5. `git pull [remote name] [branch]` if there is any existing file, like a readme created by default, or if repository is empty, there is no need to pull.
    6. `git add [file name]` to add a new file to git to be tracked. 
    7. `git commit -m 'comment'` to ceate a git checkpoint (this is like a git save of changes done to the file). This is required before a git push to update these changes in the cloud repository. (-m allows to write the message directly in the terminal)
    9. `git push origin master` to update the entire cloud repository with the locally one.
    Note: `git push --set-upstream origin master` to include [remote name] [branch] (see more on point 1st note section above)
    10. `git commit -am [comment]` to commit all tracked(already added) files.
    
    ### Other useful git commands:
    - `git mv` To mv a file that is already tracked (it is more proper than just mv)
    - `git add .gitignore` Create a file called .gitignore in each folder and write inside the files to ingore and then add it. (e.g. to ignore .ipynb_checkpoints created with jupyter-notebook; if want to ignore all files in a folder write * and then !.gitignore)
